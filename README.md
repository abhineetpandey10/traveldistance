# traveldistance

A webapp to find the driving/travel distance between two cities/locations

## Technologies used
- NodeJS/ExpressJS for Backend Server
- ReactJS for Frontend
- MapBox Directions API for getting details about the driving distance between two cities
- Nominatim API for getting the coordinates of cities/locations similar to user input

## Setting up the Project on your local machine:

To get started with working on this Project, first fork this repo:

Then, clone the fork to your local machine using the command
### `git clone https://github.com/*YOUR_USERNAME_HERE*/traveldistance.git`**

You will need a Mapbox access token for the backend server to work. Go to https://www.mapbox.com/ and create an Account there. Once you have succesfully created an 
account with Mapbox, the Mapbox Access token can be found in the **tokens** menu of the Account page.

Now, in the backend folder of the project, create a *.env* file having the following environment variable:

### `MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN = YOUR_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN`

*Congratulations, you have setup the project on your local machine for development*
